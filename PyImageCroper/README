Python script that transforms a table of images, into separate images according to the number of rows ans cols on that table,
then using trace2scad images are transformed into scad files, then those files are modified and the scad files
are rendered and exported as an stl file.

The intention was to 3D print some blocks which contained some symbols that a Japanese teacher needed to use during her class.
